     "question": "What is the relationship between the mean arrival rate and mean service rate for the existence of a steady-state solution?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Mean arrival rate = Mean service rate",
        "b": "Mean arrival rate > Mean service rate",

        "d": "Mean service rate is independent of mean arrival rate for the existence of steady-state solution"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "For mean arrival rate equals to mean service rate, traffic intensity equals to 1, which leads an infinite number of customers in the system",
        "b": "In this case, the system will collapse due to more arrival in comparison to service in a unit time",
        "c": "This leads to steady-state solution as arrivals are less than service in a unit time",
        "d": "In this case, the system will collapse due to more arrivals in comparison to service in a unit time when the arrival rate becomes greater than service rate"
