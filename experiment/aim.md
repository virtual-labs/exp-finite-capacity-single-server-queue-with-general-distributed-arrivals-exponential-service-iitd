#### The experiment aims to predict the behavior of systems that attempt to provide service for randomly arising demands through the GI/M/1/N model. More specifically, when the arrival time for an independent customer arriving in a system follows a general distribution with a single server and finite capacity, the number of customers one sees on arrival in the system, the waiting time in the system, the number of customers in the queue, and the average service time of a customer can be examined through the experiment.
